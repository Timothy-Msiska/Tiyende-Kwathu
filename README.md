# tiyende_kwathu

Tiyende Kwathu is a mobile-based application designed to reduce drunk driving in Malawi by offering a safe and reliable alternative. Inspired by South Africaâ€™s Scooter Angels, the app connects individuals who have been drinking with trained and background-checked drivers called Tiyende Kwathu Agents who drive them home in their own vehicles.
